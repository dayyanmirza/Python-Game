Let's laydown the classes we want to implement.

So what is my game going to be about. 

Title --> Paranoia

Basic Idea:
- You see great success in the business world creating a security device that protects people's computers. 
- You sell the company, but you have alot of enemies.
- You need to retreat from the US, before its too late and in order to do that you find out that you have allies in Peru find a way to get there w/ out getting killed.


Game description:

Home:
- You're going about your day, when one day a bottle is thrown at your window. The window smashes and the bottle has a note, the note says, "We know that you know".
- It's the CIA. You know it. After years of working in close conjunction with them they're afraid your recent tirades make you a weak link. They might wnat to get rid of this problem once and for all. 
- You decide its time to go, and never return. Which is simple as you don't have family that's alive anyway. 

Phonebooth:
- You leave your house and go to the phonebooth outside of the city to make sure noones listening. You call them up using a code only they know and then they say an anagram of a country to come to.
- You write the leters down and it says Peru. 
- You have to change your indentity to leave. So you meet up with a guy name Fred. 
- He's a guy you know from the CIA but you trust him. 
- You go there realise he was a phoney and then you decide to teach him a lesson. 
- Leaving there, you decide you must leave the area. 
- How? 

Plane:
- You know another guy and he actually helps you gives you a fake passport and even a small plane that he will take you to peru in but he can't at the momnet and requires some compensation.
- It's not money, he has a some beef to settle with another man. 
- He stole from him. 
- It's an online transaction, though, you've done this beofre multiple times and it's for a good cause so you help him. 
- You get the money give it to him. 
- You go on the plane area but the guy is no where to be seen. 
- But luckily theres three planes there and you've had helicopter training how hard can a plane be. 
- You pick one and from there you're on your way to peru but middle of the flight you realise your low on fuel so you do a quick emergency landing in somewhere in Ecuador. 

Ecuador:
- People try to kidnap you cause they know you have money as they recognise you from somewhere. 
- Now your in a truck and overhear the guys are going to Peru.
- You're about to arrive and you stop somewhere they open the doors and throw you out, and they start speaking in Spanish.
- One guy knows enlgish so you start talking and they are asking for alot of money cause they saw you sell your compnay in the news.
- To them you say if they take you to this spot in Peru then he knows someone that can give you the money.

Peru:
- They take you there and upon arrival they take of your harnesses cause you said you need to be normal.
- Then you meet the guy and tell them he has the money get it from him. 
- They get the guy, but they didn't realise he's not only an CIA agent you know that's left CIA, so he realises you're in trouble and he tells the guys.
- He will get the money for them, he goes and gives them 500,000 us dollars.
- They leave, but little did they know thats prop money he has back from one of his cases.

- Now you've arrived safe and sound here but are unsure what the future holds, all you need is some breathing space to think about things. But still the Paranoia remains.
